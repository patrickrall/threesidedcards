# 汉字、英文、拼音三面卡！
## Three sided cards


English speakers learning Chinese must memorize pronunciation and meaning of words, but also the characters belonging to these words. Since three pieces of information must be memorized, a flash card can no longer have just two sides.

Three sided cards contains a database of pinyin-characters-English associations, and quizzes users in all six possible directions. This way, all associations can be memorized effectively.

Quizzing is performed via the Leitner system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system). All six associations per card are separately categorized into seven boxes. Answering a question correctly moves the association into a higher box, taking more time before they being requested again.

Some features include:
+ Character drawing pad
+ Recognition of words with multiple meanings
+ Sorting into chapters

This application is designed for Caltech's L170 course in introductory Chinese.
